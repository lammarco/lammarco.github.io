									<h1>Marco Lam</h1>
								</header>
								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>My name is Marco Lam, currently studying both
									Computer Science (Specialization: Intelligent Systems) and Computer Game Science at UC Irvine.
									I am passionate in all things game-related, but especially in technical and design-related aspects.
								</p>
								<p>In fact, games make up a massive part of my life. Outside of school and chores, 
								I spend almost the rest of my time into developing or playing games, as well as writing game-related programs.
								As such, programming and math are my favorite subjects due to their ability to model and verify ideas.
								</p>

								<h4>Passion for Games</h4>
								<p>My early passion for games came from countless playthroughs of Pokemon Emerald, while the GBA and DS Megaman series helped solidify my interest.
									After that, I spent a few years playing mobile rhythm games, but have now moved on to a spree on platformers (especially metroidvanias).
									Other than those genres, I enjoy technical games such as <a href="https://www.minetest.net" target="_blank">Minetest (mesecon and pipeworks)</a></p>
								<p><u>I love glitch-hunting and technical tricks.</u> Although my player skill is lacking, seeing people push the game to its limits is always entertaining;
								the technicalities underneath make the feats all the more amazing.</p>

								<h4>A Non-technical Hobby</h4>
								<p>Outside of my technical interests, my main hobby is music &mdash; my favorite type being a mix of instrumental and electronic.
									Due to my rhythm game experiences, I prefer the complex parts in songs, whether it be rhythm or tone. 
									However, despite the genres I play, the Touhou series (EoSD, with exception of Byakuren Theme's transition to E minor)
									became my favorite game soundtrack with its vibrant and memorable melodies.
								</p>
								<p>
									As someone who enjoys creating and learning, I also learned to compose music to a degree, and ended up as the audio designer for the College Game Jam game
