									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<h4>Background</h4>
								<p>Hi, I'm Marco Lam, someone who is passionate about design and technical achievements in games. 
								   After graduating from UC Irvine with degrees in both Computer Science (Specialization: Intelligent Systems) and Computer Game Science,
								   I am currently job-searching while working on <a href="./intro.html#physics">DeltaPhysics</a>.
								</p>
								<div class="image"></div> <!-- line break -->
								
								<h4>Passion for Games</h4>
								<p>
								My early passion came from a fortunate childhood exposed to a large variety of games.
								From Pokemon and Megaman series on the DS, to various flavors of MMOs, not to mention an emerging field of mobile games, 
								my curiosity was easily occupied by these entertainment.
								</p>
								<p><u>I love technical aspects of games</u>, which not only includes glitch-hunting and technical tricks, but also automation in technical games and stat optimizations.
									An example would be <a href="https://www.luanti.org/" target="_blank" alt="luanti.org">Luanti (formerly Minetest)</a>, not just for its room for creativity, but also for its capacity as a mod engine.
									Of course, mesecon and pipeworks are a must (think: redstone builds in Minecraft).
								</p>

								<h4>Realizing Ideas with Programming</h4>
								<p>	With the drive to understand the workings of games and to formulate my own ideas, I included programming into my studies.
									In addition to providing rules and principles the videogames rely on, the field also taught me problem-solving
									and helped me translate my game ideas into coded logic.
									More recently, my interests in automation and optimization also led to the specialization in machine learning, which assisted in adapting to the recent LLM boom.
								</p>
								<div class="image"></div> <!-- line break -->
								
								<h4>Non-technical Hobbies</h4>
								<p>	Outside of technical interests, music is my main hobby â€” my favorite being a mix of instrumental and electronic.
									My preference in complex songs (whether in rhythm or tone) is influenced by experience from playing rhythm games,
									but I also enjoy a good atmospheric piece.
								</p>
								<p> 
									In addition to listening, I also enjoy messing with various sound effects and tracks.
									Humorously, acquired skills went beyond the hobby and back to my game development,
									even landing me a remote, part-time position to help design audio for the Space Zoologist game project at UC Davis.
								</p>
